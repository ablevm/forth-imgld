forth-imgld

A simple and flexible loader routine/script for working with Forth image files.

imgld.subr can be used to easily write loader scripts which inject and anchor
resource files within Forth image files. imgld.subr is intended to be used with
the img (and scr) tools.

The included imgld tool can be used to inject and anchor both Forth block and
screen files within a Forth image file. It demonstrates how an imgld.subr-based
loader script can integrate with make(1).

REQUIREMENTS

sh
forth-img
forth-scr
Make (example only)

GETTING STARTED

See example/build.sh for an example of how to inject and anchor Forth block and
screen files within a Forth image file. This example may be taken as a starting
point for more advanced loader scripts.

Examples

From the example directory, to inject and anchor all Forth screen files into a
fresh Forth image starting at block 512:

$ cp forth.img.def forth.img
$ img -r 1M forth.img
$ ./imgld -b $((512 * 1024)) -o forth.img *.scr
$

From the example directory, to inject and anchor all Forth screen files into a
existing Forth image starting at block 512:

This is very useful for live development.

$ ./imgld -b $((512 * 1024)) -o forth.img *.scr
$ 

To inject and anchor all Forth screen files from a list in a text file into an
existing Forth image starting at block 512:

$ ls *.scr > filelist.txt
$ ./imgld -b $((512 * 1024)) -o forth.img $(cat filelist.txt)
$
